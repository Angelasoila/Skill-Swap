# 💬 Skill Swap

**Learn. Teach. Grow. Together.**  
Skill Swap is a gamified, AI-powered learning platform where developers exchange knowledge, connect with mentors, and build community through skill sharing.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Skill Swap** is built to solve a real developer problem — learning in isolation. We empower developers to:
- Learn new skills
- Teach what they know
- Track their growth
- And connect with other devs across the globe

The platform combines the **social vibe of Stack Overflow**, the **gamified approach of Duolingo**, and the **matchmaking logic of LinkedIn**, all powered by AI.
